# Dental Patient Manager

## Brief 

This python project is specifically developed for a dental or medical private practice. 

This is a simple patient management system that would allow users(eg. admin) to add, view or edit  appointments, treatments and patient details. 

I decided to build this project for my 3rd portfolio project for code instutute having drawn inspiration from my current work life. 

I decided to challenge myself with a trying to complete a command line python application that would allow me to manage patients similarly to the applications used in real dental private practices.
